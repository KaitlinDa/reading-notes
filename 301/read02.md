# Reading 02 State and Props

## React lifecycle

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

    •Based on the diagram, ‘render’ happens first and then the data flows down to componentDidMount’.

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

    •The very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is that the constructor is created.

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen <code>componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates</code>.

    •<code>Constructor, render, React updates, componentDidMount,</code> and , <code>componentWillUnmount</code> is the way they happen in the React lifecycle.

4. What does <code>componentDidMount</code> do?

    •This method is invoked after a component is mounted. It executes the React code when the component is in place in the DOM.

## React State Vs Props

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?

    •Any JavaScript data types can be passed through props such as objects, arrays, functions, and components.
2. What is the big difference between props and state?

    •Props are like arguments to a function. They are what we want our components to render like. State is something inside of a component. Props pass into a component, while state is handled inside of that component while props are handles outside of the component.

3. When do we re-render our application?

    •Whenever the state or props change, we will want to re-render the application so it is in sync with the data.

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

    •In state, you can store user data, application data, and even real-time data.
