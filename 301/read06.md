## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

    •Some smart guy. He developed the HTTP protocol.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    •The machines weren’t designed to be like that. They just needed to talk to a small group of machines, not all the machines.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

• It’s applying verbs to nouns. When you arrive to a webpage, the browser does a HTTP GET on the URL which brings up a webpage. If there are images on the web page, the browser does more GETS using the protocols until all the resources for a web page is displayed.

4. What does a <code> GET</code> do?

    •It is a request of the HTTP protocol that is used by the client to request a resource from a web server.

5. What does a <code>POST</code> do?

• It is a request of the HTTP protocol used by the client to submit data that is processed by the web server.

6. What does <code>PUT</code> do?

    •It is a request of the HTTP protocol used by the client to update an existing resource on a web server or to create a new resource if it doesn’t already exist.

7.  What does <code>PATCH</code> do?

 •It is a request of the HTTP protocol used by the client to make partial updates to an existing resource on a web server.
