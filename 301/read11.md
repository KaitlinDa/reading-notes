# Read 11 MongoDB and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

    •SQL databases are primarily called Relation Databases (RDBMS) while NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed database.

    •SQL databases are tabled based databases representing data in the forms of tables consisting of n number of rows of data while NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores not having a standard schema definition it adheres to.

    •SQL databases have a predefined schema while NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

    •SQL databases are vertically scalable where NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

    •SQL databases use SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating data while NoSQL database queries focus on the collection of documents.

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

    •Structured data is a good fit for SQL databases.

3. Give a real world example.

    •Any sort of a user’s profile, such as their username, password, or email are a real-world example of a good data fit for SQL databases.

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

    •Any data types that don’t fit the structured SQL databases are a good fit for NoSQL database.

5. Give a real world example.

    •Logging a user’s session on a web page is a real-world example of this. It’s suited for managing user sessions and caching the data.

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    •NoSQL databases are best for hierarchical data storage.

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?

    •It depends, SQL databases are vertically scalable while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

## sql vs nosql

1. What does SQL stand for?

    •SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

2. What is a relational database?

    •A relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in a structures format.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

    •Relational databases work with tables, rows, columns, SQL, and indexes.

4. What is a ‘schema’?

    •A schema is the overall structure that defines how a database is organized and how the data within is arranged.

5. What is a NoSQL database?

    •A NoSQL database is a type of database that is used to store and retrieve data types and structures.

6. How does it work?

    •They work by allowing for more flexible data models. Data is stored and retrieved.

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?

    •You will find collections and documents. Collections are tables in relational databases which allows for the structure of flexible data. Documents are records kept within that collection.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    •MongoDB, due to the data model and schema management.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    •There is no standardization within this database and there are issues with data consistency.
