# Read 09 Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?

    •Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

    •Pure functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming. There are strict definitions in order for a function to be considered a pure function. It does not cause any observable side effects and it returns the same result of the given same arguments (also called deterministic).

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

    •Pure functions allow for easier testing and debugging as well as predictability. They produce the same output when given the same input.

4. What is immutability?

    •Immutability is a concept in which once the object is created, it can NOT be modified.

5. What is Referential transparency?

    •Referential transparency describes an expression. A function or expression will always give the same output if given the same input.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1. What is a module?

    •A module is a self-contained component that encapsulates data. They are more manageable, maintainable, and reusable.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?

    •This is often used as a mechanism that uses external code in your code.

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

    •In JavaScript you can use <code>require</code> to import modules into the code you are working in.

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

    •You need to first create the module, export the functionality, publish the module, import and then use it.
