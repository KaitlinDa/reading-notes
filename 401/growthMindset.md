## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

Yet is a powerful word that gives you a path into the future. Using Not Yet gives an individual a reason to continue. It isn't failure, it's a need to progress. Growth mindset is when you know capabilities can be developed. A fixed mindset leaves you in the now instead of progressing into the future. Individuals who were not taught growth mindset showed a decline in their studies. Equality happens when growth mindset is shown.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

Our lives are regulary threatened filled with anxiety. One of these reasons is because we are surrounded by snobs. We are not necessarily greedy, but we want the feel of the reward itself. A meritocratic society is where talent, energy, and skill will get you to the top position. A downside of this is when a person is at the bottom, they deserve to be there. This makes failure harder to get out of. We tend to worship ourselves as a society instead of other things like gods, nature, etc. We have strict beliefs of what successful means that differ per individual.

## Your Biases

I scored under 74, so I have significant room for improvement. While I may not agree with this score, I am always looking for ways to improve. One of my greatest weaknesses is finding meaningful connections with individuals. I am typically shy and steer away from others. 

## Things I want to Know More About
