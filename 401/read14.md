# Read 14 Visualization

## Reading Questions
1. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

    - Matplotlib is used for 2D plotting. It allows a user to control every aspect of a graph / plot. It is best used for static and animated visualizations. A plot or bar graph are examples of this.
    - Seaborn provides an interface for drawing interactive statistical graphs. It integrates pandas data structures. It is mainly used for statistical graphs. An example of this is a heat map that displays distribution and density. 
    - Bokeh is an interactive and real-time streaming plots. It is used for creating interactive plots in web browsers. An example of this is an interactive dashboard with real-time data streaming. 

2. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.
    - Relational Plots: `relplot()` are used to show statistical relationships using scatter or line plots. They are great for understanding the relationship between different variables. 
    - Categorical Plots: `catplot()` are used to provide access to axes-level functions that show the relationship between numerical and categorical variables. This can be done by using boxplots, barplots, and others. They are great for comparing the distribution of variables between classes. 
    - Distribution Plots: `distplot()` are used for visualizing the distribution of data. This can be done by using a histogram. It shows the distribution between different variables. 

3. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?
* It can be a quick reference, a learning tool, or something to increase efficiency for any developer. The syntax examples can be copied and pasted for quick work. It also summarized functions that are available for different type of data visualization.
