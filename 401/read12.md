## Reading Questions
1. Explain the purpose and basic functionality of the Pandas library. What are some common operations that can be performed on data using Pandas, and how do they contribute to data analysis and manipulation?
- The Pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis. It is great for handling tabular data which is data stored in databases or spreadsheets. Some common operations that can be performed on this data is data selection / filtering, grouping, and joining / merging data types. It allows for versatility, ease of use, and a wide variety of functionalities. 

2. What are the primary data structures in Pandas, and how do they differ in terms of use cases?
- There are two main primary data structures in Pandas, dataframe and series. Dataframe is ideal for storing and manipulating tabular data. It is suited for more complex data manipulation such as data cleaning and statistical analysis. Series are more useful when dealing with single data columns like a table. They are useful when operations require a 1-D array. 

3. Describe the process of loading a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. What are some common file formats that can be used, and which Pandas functions are utilized to read these formats?
- Loading the Pandas DataFrame allows you to work with and mmanipulate data. It allows for a range of functions that makes it possible to read data from various file formats converting them into dataframe objects. Some of these common file formats are:
    * Comma-Separated Values (CSV) - `pandas.read_csv()` used to read from a CSV file. Each line is a data record that is separated by commas
    * Excel Files - `pandas.read_excel()` reads data from an Excel spreadsheet
    * SQL Database - `pandas.read_sql()` reads data from a SQL.
