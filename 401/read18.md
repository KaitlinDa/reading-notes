## Reading Questions
1. What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?
* The Caesar Cipher is used for securing messages. It involves shifting letters of the alphabet by fixed numbers. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext message a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. To decrypt the message, the receiver shifts the letters in the opposite direction by the same number of positions.

2. What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?
* In symmetric encryption, the same key is used to lock and unlock the message, which is fast but can be risky if someone else gets the key. In asymmetric encryption, there are two keys: one public key to lock (encrypt) the message and a different private key to unlock (decrypt) it, which is safer. Asymmetric encryption is commonly used for secure emails and safe websites, helping to keep information private and proving that it really came from the right person or place.

3. How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.
* Computers can make random numbers in two ways: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) use natural, unpredictable things to create really random numbers. These are great for cryptography where high security, like making unpredictable keys, is needed. Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) use math formulas to make numbers that seem random. They're faster and good for things like computer simulations where you might need to repeat the same "random" sequence.

4. Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.
* Encryption is like putting a valuable item Encryption is like putting a valuable item (your message) into a chest and locking it with a special key (the encryption key), so that only people with the correct key can open it. This keeps the item safe from anyone who shouldn't see it. Decryption is the opposite: it's like using the right key to unlock the chest and take out the valuable item, making it accessible again to those who are meant to see it.
