# Practice in the Terminal

## The Command Line

The command line (also known as a terminal) is a text based interface to a machine. A user can enter commands into the terminal and feedback will appear. It is fairly to open a terminal. I use windows, and I and type cmd to pull up my Windows terminal. 

## Basic Navigation

The command pwd tells you what your current working directory is. The ls command will list what is in that directory. The ls command is more powerful than pwd, because it can have arguments. The cd command is used to move around in your system.

## More About Files

Everything in linux is a file. Spaces in names are ok, but you have to be careful when using them. This is because we use spaces to separate items on the command line. Single or double quotes can be put around anything to be considered a single item. A backslash is used to nullify any special meaning that is next to a character. 

## Manual Pages

Manual pages are a set of pages that is used to explain every command that is availablw on your system. Manually searching for something in your Manual pages is possible by pressing a forward slash followed by the item you are looking for. 

## File Manipulation

Files in linus are organized in a hierarchical way. It is important to keep your files organized and you can do this by the mkdir command which makes a directory (folder). When using the mkdir command, you can use -p which makes the parent directory as needed or -v which tells us what is going on. Use the rmdir command to remove a directory. The touch command is used to create a new file. You can copy a file or directory by using cp source destination. A file can be moved by using mv source destination.
