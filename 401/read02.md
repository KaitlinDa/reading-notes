# Read Class 02 Testing and Modules

## Reading Questions

1. What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?

* The key principles of TDD in Python are writing tests before code, baby step approach, red-green-refactor cycle, focus on software design, and continuous feedback. These all provide a safety net that makes code more reliable and easier to modify if needed over time. 

2. Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?

* It is used for deciding how a script will run by either an imported module or as the main program. It can be used for code organization, testing, and debugging. Overall, it enhances the reuseability and flexibility of your code. 

3. Describe the concept of recursion in Python.

* Recursion is when a function calls itself either directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem. A recursive function calls itself with a more simple version of the original issue. This is a continuous process that will continue until a base case is reached. 

4. What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.

* A Python module is a file that contains Python definitions and statements. A module can be created by ysing `.py`. You use an `import` statement in order to import the module. A Python package is used to structure a Python's module by using dotted module names. It is a directory that contains a special file. You would also use an `import` statement along with a package's dot notation.
