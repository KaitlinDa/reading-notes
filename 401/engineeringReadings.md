## Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

* With my background in science, I bring a unique analytical and experimental approach to problem solving that is rooted in to the scientific method. I can apply empirical and data-driven techniques that allows me to develop solutions that are not only creative but also tested and validated.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* In order to help unstick myself on touch pieces of code, I will take it one step at a time. Sometimes you have to go back a step or two or all of it to clear your mind and get back on the right track. I will also take more mental breaks. I do have a tough time when I get frustarated in something I am doing, and it prevents me from doing my best. In this situation, I will take a step back to recompose myself. Finally, I will ask for help. I do get sucked into what I am doing and will go down rabbit holes when the person sitting next to me most likely already knows the answer. 

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know about more ways I can try to help me with coding issues.
