## Reading Questions
1. What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?
* The key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model over the default Django User Model include enhanced flexibility and scalability. With a Custom User Model, developers can define additional user information fields and authentication methods from the start, catering to specific project requirements. This approach is different from the default User Model, which comes with predefined fields such as username, email, and password. Customizing at the beginning of a project prevents complex migrations later on, as altering the user model after the project has been deployed is challenging and not recommended.

2. Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.
* Creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django involves several steps. First, define a new model that extends AbstractUser or AbstractBaseUser in your models.py. This model should include any additional fields and methods required for your application. Next, update settings.py with AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'yourapp.YourCustomUserModel' to tell Django to use your custom model instead of the default one. Finally, create and apply migrations to add your custom user model to the database.

3. What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project.
* DjangoX is a project template designed to help give developers a head start with a Django project. It complements Django by including pre-configured apps, settings, and development tools that are commonly used in Django projects, such as user authentication, static files setup, and third-party libraries for improved functionality. For example, incorporating DjangoX in a project can be highly beneficial for rapid development, as it might include configurations for Docker, user authentication views, and custom user models, saving developers time and effort in setting up these components from scratch.
