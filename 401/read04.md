## Reading Questions
1. What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
* Classes are a template used to help you create your objects while an object are encapsulations of variables and functions located in a single entity. Classes and objects work together in Python to create and manage instances of a class. 

2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
* Recursion is where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It breaks down a bigger task into a smaller one making it more manageable. An example of this in Python would be to calculate the factorial of a number. Some of the best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function is to define a base case to prevent infinite loops, use it wisely, and consider the memory and performance of your device. 

3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
* They are important concepts in testing Python code. They work together to maintain the project and enhance the quality. You can write effective tests in order to use these two concepts together. 

## Things I want to know more about
Recursion is still a bit confusing to me and it seems like there is so much that could go wrong. I want to know more about it and how to properly use it in order to troubleshoot.
