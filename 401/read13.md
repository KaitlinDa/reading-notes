# Read 13 Linear Regressions

## Reading Questions
1. Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?
* Linear regression is the relationship between two or more variables by fitting a linear equation to see the data. It can predict the value of dependent variables based on the independent variables in machine learning and data analysis. 

2. Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.
* You first need to import all necessary libraries, then load the dataset and prepare it for the model. After, split the data into test sets and make a linear regression model. Fit the model to your training data and then make predictions with the model. Finally, evaluate the model for the data you are looking for. 

3. What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?
* Splitting the dataset into train and test sets allows for robust evaluation of a model's performance. It ultiminately assesses the model's ability to generalize the new data. It contributes to the evaluation of machine learning model's performance by adding accuracy and precision. It also helps select the best model for the problem. 

## Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about how to use these features for coding. It seems like there's alot of different directions one can go.
