## Reading Questions
1. What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
* JupyterLab is a next-generation web based user interface. It allows a user to work with documents and activities such as text editors, terminals, and custom components. It has a file explorer which opens other notebooks and files, offers a wide variety of extensions, and real time collaboration. The key difference between Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook is that Jupyter Lab has a more complex UI and offers more customization. 

2. What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?
* Some of the main functionalities provided by the Numpy library is mathematical functions that operate on arrays boosting performance, array broadcasting that simplified operations on arrays, and random number generations which is important for simulations. It can be useful in Python programming in that it allows for data analysis and manipulation allowing for complex operations to be handled and is an indispensable tool. 

3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
* Numpy arrays are used mainly for numerical computing. All of their elements are of the same data. Their arrays allow for different dimensions: 1-D, 2-D, and N-D. In order to create a NumPy array, you must first install it by typing in `import numpy as np`. An example of what one of these arrays would look like in Python is `np_array = np.array([1,2,3])`. To manipulate the array, you can reshape, slice, or flatten them. An example to flatten an array is to use `flat_array = np_array.flatten()`. An example to perform an operation of them is to use `mean_va1 = np_array.mean()` to allow for a statistical operation.
