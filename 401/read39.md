## Reading Questions
1. What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?
* React Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you have global data that many components might need access to, such as the current authenticated user, theme settings, or language preferences. React Context helps in managing state and sharing data by making it accessible to all components in the tree, regardless of how deep they are, which simplifies the data flow and component structure.

2. Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.
* The useContext Hook is a part of React's Hooks API that allows functional components to access the value of a React Context. This hook takes the context object (the value returned from React.createContext) as its argument and returns the current context value for that context. The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest <Context.Provider> above the calling component in the tree.

3. Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.
* Next.js is a React framework designed to provide a set of features, such as server-side rendering and static site generation, that help build scalable and performant web applications. It simplifies the process of optimizing React apps by handling routing, page pre-rendering, and many other features out of the box. Next.js is especially well-suited for applications that benefit from optimized SEO, faster page loads through server-side rendering, and simplified page routing.
