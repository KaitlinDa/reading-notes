## Reading Questions

1. In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

    * There is alot to learn about Python. It is a new language you are essentially learning. The main challenge for this course is that this learning process is very accelerated. We will be learning more in 10 weeks than people in University learn in 2 years. Two strategies to for overcoming this obstacle is to remember why you are doing this. What we are learning is painful, but we all have a reason to be here. Use that reason to get you by. Also, take it a step at a time. Don't try to take in everything at once. Give yourself time. 

2. After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

    * Time complexity and space complexity are both concepts used in computer science. They evaluate how an algorithm is performed in both time and space requirements. Time complexity is the execution time of an algorithm as it grows with the size of input. Space complexity indicates how much memory an algorithm uses relating to the input size. 

3. Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

    * The main difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python is how their values can be modified after they are created. Mutable data types can be modified after they are created while immutable data types cannot be changed after they are created. 

## Things I want to know more about

I am very excited to be learning about Python. I don't know very much about it as of it, but that will change.
