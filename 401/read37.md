## Reading Questions
1. After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?
* Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides predefined classes, allowing developers to style their HTML directly within the markup. The purpose of utility classes in Tailwind is to increase efficiency, maintainability, and scalability of CSS styling by offering a more functional approach. Instead of writing custom CSS with a a variety of selectors and properties, developers can use Tailwind's utility classes to apply specific styles directly to HTML elements. This method significantly speeds up the development process.

2. Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.
* Next.js offers several advantages for web development, including server-side rendering (SSR), automatic code splitting, and optimized performance. SSR improves SEO and initial page load times by rendering pages on the server and sending fully formed HTML to the client. In contrast, traditional client-side rendering relies on the browser to render content dynamically, which can lead to slower initial load times and potentially poorer SEO, as search engines may have difficulty indexing content that is rendered client-side. Next.js bridges the gap by providing the best of both worlds: the SEO and performance benefits of server-side rendering, along with the interactivity and dynamism of client-side JavaScript frameworks.

## Things I want to know more about
I would like to know how to better use Tailwind to my advantage. We had used it once before, but there are so many options to use when using it.
