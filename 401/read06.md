## Reading Questions
1. How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?
* It is a useful tool used for generating random numbers and making random selections from a list. Some common functions available within this module are `random.random():`, `random.uniform(a, b):`, and `random.choice(seq):`.

2. In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?
* Risk analysis in software development is a process used to identify, assess, and prioritize potential risks that could negatively impact a software project. The steps involved is to identify risks, set an assessment and prioritization of those risks, plan them out, and implement mitigation strategies. 

3. What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?
* It is a metric used to measure the extent in which source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite is ran. It is important, because it identifies gaps in test cases, ensures code reliablity, and reduces bug count. 

4. What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.
* It is a mathematical notation used in computer science that is used to describe the performance of an algorithm. It characterizes the running time or space requirements of an algorithm. An example of this is folding laundry. you have a pile of `n` clothing items to fold. The time it takes to complete the folding task is directly proportional to the number of items.Each additional item adds a relatively fixed amount of additional work, making the total effort scale linearly with the number of items.

## Things I want to know more about
I would like to know how the Big O notation can be used in different scenerios.
