## The code I'm still ashamed of
* The article talks about a software developer who was asked to create a quiz for a website aimed at teenage girls, designed to always recommend a specific drug, no matter what their answers were. This task made the developer think deeply about the ethics involved in coding, because the quiz could mislead people and affect their health. The situation became more serious when the developer learned about a young girl who had harmed herself after taking the drug recommended by the quiz. This tragic incident made the developer realize the real-world impact of their work and the importance of thinking about the consequences of the code they write. Feeling responsible and troubled by the harm caused, the developer decided to quit their job. This story shows how important it is for developers to consider the ethical impact of their work, as it can have serious effects on people's lives. I agree he did the right thing.
