# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

* When choosing a data structure, it is important to know the efficiency of operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and updating. You want to evaluate the data and required operations in order to select the most suitable data structure. 

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

* In order to avoid an infinite recursive call stack, you will want to always define a base case. This will ensure that a function won't endlessly try calling on itself. 

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about choosing the right data structure for intended purposes. Sometimes, I feel it can be a bit subjective, so I want to learn ways to help me figure out what the best move would be.
