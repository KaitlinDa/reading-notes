# My Code Fellow Reading Notes

***My Code Fellows reading notes***

**Growth mindset** is where you don't see failure as a stopping point, but as a learning point. As long as you keep trying, you will succeed. 

Reminders for Growth mindset
1. Accept and learn from your mistakes.
1. Be patient and take the time you need to improve.
1. Everything is hard teh first time you do it. Keep doing it, and it will become easier. 

Thank you for reading my Lab01b assignment! My name is Kaitlin Davis and I am currently a student at Code Fellows. I have not done coding before, but I love to try new things and enjoy techy stuff. If you are interested, below is my Github webpage with more information about me.
