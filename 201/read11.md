# Read Class 11 Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio Content

1.	Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

    •	In the early 2000s, plug-ins were required in order to use audio and video on the web. The quality of the video and audio suffered due to low bandwidth. It has quite evolved since then. Flash is no longer a thing, video and audio now have live streaming capabilities, and the accessibility is great for users who have disabilities.

2.	Describe the use of the <code>src</code> and <code>controls</code> attributes in the <code><video></code> element.

    •	<code>src</code> contains a path to the video that you want to embed. <code>controls</code> will display the browser’s default video controls to the user.

3.	Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <code><video></code> element?

    •	It is important to have fallback content inside the <code><video></code> element, because it improves accessibility to users who rely on screenreaders, improves a user’s experience, and allows compatibility to users who might be using older browsers that don’t recognize certain things.

4.	Write a very short story where <code><audio></code> and <code><video></code> are characters.

    •	In the land of Websiteopia, <code><audio></code> was the spirit of sound, while <code><video></code> was the artist who painted stories across the canvas of screens. Together, they were siblings of harmony, separate they did not work like things intended. Together, they drew tales and visions that slowed seamlessly into the hearts and minds of all.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1.	How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

    •	Gris layout is a 2D system for creating complex grid-based layouts while Flex is a 1D system used for aligning elements within a single row or column.

2.	Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

    •	A grid container is a HTML element that is designated as a grid by applying the CSS <code>display:grid</code>. It establishes a new grid formatting context and follows the rules of the grid layout defined by the container.

    •	A grid item is any direct child element of a grid container that is involved in the grid layout. They can be positioned within the grid container’s row and columns. Their placement, size, and alignment can be controlled.

    •	Grid lines are horizontal and vertical lines that make up grid structures within a grid container. They are defined as the boundaries of the rows and columns in the grid.

## Responsive Images

1.	Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

    •	Making images responsive helps to ensure a positive experience for the user while also improving performance, reducing data usage, and maintains good search engine ranking.

2.	Define the following <code><img></code> attributes <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code>. Write an example of how they are used.

    •	<code>srcset</code> this allows you to specify multiple image sources along with their respective descriptors. The browser uses this information in order to select the best image based on the user’s device capabilities.

    •	<code>sizes</code> this specifies the sizes of the image’s display area relative to the viewport width. It notifies the browser how much space the image will occupy on screen under different conditions.

3.	How is <code>srcset</code> more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

    •	<code>srcset</code> more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript, because it offers native browser support, better accessibility, and automatic image selection based on a device’s capability.
