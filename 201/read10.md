# Read Class 10 Debugging

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1.	Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

    •	Syntax errors are spelling errors within your code. They cause the program not to run or will make your code stop half way through. You will usually be notified by error messages and are typically good to fix if you know how.

    •	Logic errors are when the syntax is correct, but the code is not. The program will run successfully, but give you incorrect results. There typically isn’t an error message that explains the issue.

2.	List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

    •	I have had quite a few syntax errors in my past lab assignments. I was able to correct them by using error messages to help me identify them. If I wasn’t sure what the error message was asking, Google did. Some of these errors include a missing ; at the end, or () were incorrectly placed. The biggest one for me is {}.

3.	How will this topic continue to influence your long-term goals?

    •	This topic has given me insight on the many different errors I can face while coding. This has influenced me to make mistakes and learn from them, which is what I plan to do.

## The JavaScript Debugger.

1.	How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

    •	The JavaScript Debugger tool is an important tool for software developers. It can help identify and fix errors within your code. You can think of it as a detective who investigates your code and finds the issues.

2.	Define what a breakpoint is.

    •	Breakpoints are stop points you can place in your code. When your code reaches this stop point, it pauses, allowing you to examine what is happening within your code.

3.	What is the call stack?

    •	The call stack keeps track of the order in which your functions are called and manages the execution. It ensures that all functions have been executed and returned in the correct order.

## Things I want to know more about

The debugging tool seems like a very cool tool to be able to know how to use. I want to know more about this in order to help with my code.
