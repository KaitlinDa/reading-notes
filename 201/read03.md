# Read 03 Readings: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model 

## Learn HTML

### Ordered and Unordered lists.

1.	When should you use an <code>unordered list</code>  in your HTML document?

* You should use unordered lists in your code when you want to list things not in a specific order.

2.	How do you change the <code>bullet style</code>  of unordered list items?

* You can change the bullet styles by going into CSS  and customizing the appearance of the bullet that way.

3.	When should you use an <code>ordered list</code>   vs an <code>unorder list</code>  in your HTML document?

* You should use <code>ordered list</code>   when you want things listed in a specific order.

4.	Describe two ways you can change the numbers on <code>list items</code>  provided by an <code>ordered list</code> ?

* Two ways you can change numbers this way is by using <code>type</code> or <code>start</code> . When you use <code>type</code>, you can choose from letters to Roman numerals. If you use <code>start</code> , this will start you off at whatever you put.

## Learn CSS

### The Box Model.

1.	Describe the CSS properties of <code>margin</code>  and <code>padding</code>  as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

* In the land of InterWorld, the Box model had two characters: Margin and Padding. Margain, the guardian of Space, maintained order by giving elements their personal space, ensuring they did not feel cramped or crowded. Padding, the Comfort Giver, created a cozy layer within elements, shielding them from the outside world’s harshness, providing comfort and security. It is with the power of Margain and Padding that all elements in the Box Model coexisted peacefully with space and comfort.

2.	List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the <code>box model</code> .

    * Content box: The area where content is displayed. It can be sized using <code>inline-size</code> and <code>block size</code> or <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
    * Padding box: This sits around the content as white space. It can be sized using <code>padding</code>.
    * Border box: This wraps the content and any padding. It can be sized using <code>border</code>.
    * Margin box: This is the outermost layer that wraps the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements. You can size it using <code>margin</code>.

## Learn JS

### Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

1.	What <code>data types</code>  can you store inside of an <code>Array</code> ?

* Strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays can be stored inside of an <code>Array</code>.

2.	Is the <code>people</code>  array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

* Yes, it is. To access the values stored in it, you can use array indexing.

3.	List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

    * Assignment = : Used to assign a value to a variable or property. 
    * Additon assignment += : Used to perform addition on two operands and assigns the result to the left operand. 
    * Subtraction assignment -= : Used to perform subtraction on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
    * Multiplication assignment *= : Used to perform multiplication on two operands and assigns the result to the left operand. 
    * Division assignment /= : Used to perform division on two operands and assins the result to the left operand.
4.	Read the code below and evaluate the last <code>expression</code>  and explain what the result would be and why.

* The results would be (10 + false) + ‘dog which would create ‘10dog’ string. This is because of the variables and what they are assigned.

5.	Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

* User authentication is a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JS program. A conditional statement can be used to check whether a user’s provided username and password match.

6.	Give an example of when a <code>Loop</code> is useful in JavaScript.

* A code loop is useful in JS when you want an individual to fill something out. They would be brought back to that question if they did not fill it out.

## Things I want to know more about

There are so many operators that can be used in JavaScript, I would like to know more about them.
