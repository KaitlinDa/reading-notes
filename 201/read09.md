### Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.

1.	Why are forms so important in web development?

    •	Forms are very important in web development when trying to get user input. They allow for data collection, processing, and privacy. There are validation methods put into place to make sure forms are filled out correctly.

2.	When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

    •	Clarity of what the form is asking is a big thing to take into consideration when it comes to user experience. Accessibility is also very important.

## Learn JS 

### Introduction To Events.

1.	How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

    •	JavaScript events can be explained as things that happen when using a website. JavaScript helps the web page respond to those things that allows it to be more interactive for the user.

2.	When using the <code>addEventListener()</code> method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

    •	The <code>addEventListener()</code> method requires the event string text and the function / handler.

3.	Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

    •	The event object in JS contains information about events that occur on a web page. The target property is useful, because it identifies specific DOM elements that trigger an event.

4.	What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

    •	Event bubbling and event capturing determine the order in which the event handlers are invoked during the start of an event. Event bubbling starts at the main of the target element and moves up to the ancestors. Event capturing starts at the root and moves down to the target.
