## Question: How do you make a cake?

## Answer from AI:

### Baking a cake is a delicious and satisfying endeavor. Here's a basic recipe for a simple vanilla cake. You can customize it by adding frosting, fillings, or other flavorings to suit your taste:

Ingredients:

For the Cake:

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk (or 1 cup milk mixed with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice, let sit for 5 minutes)
Instructions:

Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.

Sift Dry Ingredients: In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set this aside.

Cream Butter and Sugar: In another mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy.

Add Eggs and Vanilla: Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then add the vanilla extract. Mix well.

Alternate Wet and Dry Ingredients: Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in three parts, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Do not overmix, as it can make the cake tough.

Divide and Pour: Divide the batter equally between the two prepared cake pans.

Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.

Cool: Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, and then remove them from the pans to cool completely on a wire rack.

Now you have a basic vanilla cake. You can frost it with your choice of frosting, such as chocolate ganache, buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or any other flavor you prefer. You can also add fillings like fruit preserves or chocolate mousse between the cake layers for added flavor and texture.

Enjoy your homemade cake!
