## CSS Transforms

1.	What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

    •	It allows a developer to change both the position and appearance of an element without messing with the flow of the document.

2.	Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

<code>&lt;style&gt;</code>

<code>.box {
    width: 50px;
    height: 100px;
    transform: rotate(45deg);
}</code>

<code>&lt;/style&gt;</code>

<code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>

<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>

<code>&lt;div class="box"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>

<code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>


The above is an example of a transform. When using this ‘transform’ property with ‘rotate’, the square will rotate by 45 degrees.
