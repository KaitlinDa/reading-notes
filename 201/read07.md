# Read Class 07 Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

1.	Explain why we need domain modeling.

    •	We need domain modeling, because of how crucial it is in understanding and representing real-world concepts, processes, and systems. It is essential in design, understanding, and efficiency for software development.

## HTML Table Basics

1.	Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

    •	Tables should not be used for page layouts, because they reduce the accessibility for impaired users, produce tag soup (the code being harder to maintain, debug, and write), and are not automatically responsive.

2.	List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML<code> table</code>.

    •	<code>td</code> represents a standard data table cell. It is used to hold actual data in the table.

    •	<code>th</code> represents a table header cell. It is used to provide labels for the rows and columns.

    •	<code>tr</code> represents a table row. It is used to group a set of table cells.

## Introducing Constructors

1.	What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

    •	A constructor is a function called using <code>new</code>. It is used to create and initialize objects. The advantages of using a constructor are consistency throughout the code, reusability to allow for multiple instances of the same type of object, and readable code.

2.	How does the term <code>this</code> differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

    •	When <code>this</code> is used in an object literal, it refers to the object itself, while in a constructor function it refers to the instance that is being created.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1.	Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

    •	My previous work experience was a Downstream Technician at a biopharma company.

    1.	Prototypes are like Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These are step-by-step instructions and procedures required for creating specific drug component.

    2.	Inheritance is building onto those existing SOPs to create new drug formulations or to refine a process. You don’t start from scratch; you revise the procedures and methods.

## Things I want to know more about

•Tables are a bit more challenging than I realized. There is a lot that goes into making one and the data type that goes into it. I would like to know more about them.
