## Questions and Answers

### Getting Started

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

* HTTP sends data by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers. The client sends a request, while a server sends a response to that request.

* The process starts when a client sends a request to the server that specifies what the client wants to access. Before the request is sent, a Domain Name System (DNS) resolved the domain name URL to an IP address. The client opens a network connection to the server using the establish IP address and port in the URL/ When the connection is established, the client sends out a HTTP request to the server which is transmitted over an internet connection. The server receives the HTTP request, processes it, and looks for what is being requested. When the request is processed, the server will generate a HTTP response and sends it back to the client over the same connection. When the client receives the request, it gets processed.

* Poem:
HTTP is like a digital song we sing,
From client to servers, the information flies with wings.
Requests and responses may sway,
But you will get the information that same day.

1. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

* When a webpage is loaded, HTML,CSS, and JS are parsed and processed in a specific order in order to render the content. The file specific to the URL is fetched by the browser. It is parsed from top to bottom creating a Document Object Model (DOM) which constructs a render tree. Tokenization breaks down the file into sequences, in which the browser uses them to create a DOM tree. When this is made, any external resources are processed.
