# Class 06 Readings: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

1.	How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

    •	An object in coding can be thought of like real-life objects. There are different objects in real-life, such as cars, boats, shopping carts. Each of these objects have their own specific function and do certain things. An object in coding is a digital version of this. 
2.	What are some advantages to creating object literals?

    •	Some advantages of creating object literals is readability and flexibility in your code. 

3.	How do objects differ from arrays?

    •	Objects and arrays differ in their purpose and characteristics. Objects are unordered while arrays are ordered making arrays better for ordered collections and objects better for key value pairs.

4.	Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.

    •	Bracket notation is an alternative way to access object properties. You would bracket notation over dot notation when you want to access an object’s property when there is any special characters involved.

5.	Evaluate the code below. What does the term <code>this</code> refer to and what is the advantage to using <code>this</code>?

    •	The <code>this</code> code refers to an object, which is ‘dog’. In ‘this.name’ and ‘this.age’, it is referring to the ‘dog’ object. Using the <code>this</code> code is great in this example, because it allows the reference to the object.

## Introduction To The DOM

1.	What is the DOM?

    •	DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a data representation of objects that are compose of structures and content of a document on the web. It is a programming interface for web documents.

2.	Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

    •	DOM is the interface between web content and JavaScript. Interactive web pages are achieved when JavaScript manipulates DOM. These two are both fundamental to web development.
